## Description 

The Fitness Tracker is an app which allows the user to add exercises to a database, and also view a page which displays summary data on the last seven workouts.

The app interacts with a database containing "Workout" objects, and each Workout contains an array of "Exercises." The home page of the app allows the user to choose either to begin a new Workout or continue with the most recent Workout in the database.<h4>Click [here](https://quiet-fjord-49464.herokuapp.com) for deployed application.</h4>
